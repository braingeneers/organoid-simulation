    "Create an Organoid object representing 1000 cortical neurons at uniformly random locations in the region of interest. The scale of the physical position is calculated from a number given by Collins (2016) for the areal density of cells in chimpanzee neocortex: about 20 million cells per square centimeter of cortical surface. That means 1000 cells exist in an area 70$\\mu m$ on a side.\n",
    "\n",
    "The neuron parameters are of course adapted from Izhikevich's work, a combination of the approach from the 2003 paper (whose demonstration is reproduced here) with the data from _Dynamical Systems in Neuroscience_. Two different versions of the model are used in these two sources, and although they are obviously topologically conjugate, they are not algebraically equivalent for any set of parameter values. Combined with the sensitivity of the behavior of both models to the exact values of the parameters, this has meant that I have not been able to reproduce the clear $\\alpha$ and $\\gamma$ rhythms of the original demonstration. Additionally, it seems the more biophysically accurate model is even easier to drive into what amounts to epilepsy: perhaps the scale on the recovery variable $u$ is smaller here?\n",
    "\n",
    "The synaptic weight matrix entries $S_{ij}$ are distributed according to Song (2005), who described measurements of EPSPs in layer-V pyramidal cells in rat V1. The result was that EPSP strength is lognormally distributed (they gave parameters, which are reproduced below) and does not depend substantially on distance within the range of about 50um that thye tested. Values sampled from their distribution are converted from mV EPSPs to pA EPSCs by multiplying by a typical value of $C\\over\\tau$ (the membrane capacitance divided by the EPSC decay time constant); this can be derived by integrating the effect of the EPSC on the membrane voltage in the absence of leakage and setting it equal to the desired EPSP value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Song (2005) measured only *E*PSPs, but I need to consider inhibitory cells as well in order to have any hope of reproducing the dynamics of real neurons. Here, I make the certainly-false assumption that inhibitory cells have the same distribution. In fact, since inhibitory neurons are typically local interneurons, the distribution of IPSP strength should be expected to depend on distance, but I have no data on this yet. Additionally, I assume that inhibitory cells are twice as strong as excitatory cells to make up for their lesser numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The latter assumption has some basis in fact, but the mechanism and number are completely fabricated. In the real brain, both shunt and series inhibition occur; whereas series inhibition behaves like excitation, shunt inhibition increases the local leakage to prevent EPSPs from moving past a certain point in the dendrite. This means that in addition to having a different concept of strength, shunt inhibition requires at least some form of dendritic modeling, so it has been ignored for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the model is completely deterministic except for an input $I_{\\text{th}}$ from background thalamic activity. Since we have no way to model this, we assume it is Gaussian with no time-dependence, and all $N$ of these currents are independent of each other. Trial and error yielded values which give apparently-sane results in Izhikevich's demos: each has mean zero, but the input to excitatory cells is 1.5x larger than the input to inhibitory cells in order to create the correct balance between their firing rates.\n",
